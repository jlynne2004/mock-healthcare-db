# Sleep Disorders KPI Dashboard

A comprehensive Power BI dashboard for tracking key performance indicators related to sleep disorder diagnostics, created to demonstrate data visualization and healthcare analytics capabilities.

## Project Overview
Working for a company that specializes in sleep care studies, I know that sleep disorders are becoming more prevalent. This project showcases how data visualization can help healthcare providers track important metrics related to sleep disorder diagnosis and treatment.

## Repository Contents
- Python script for data processing and preparation
- Excel dataset with mock sleep disorder metrics
- Power BI dashboard file with interactive visualizations

### Title and Data Disclaimer
![Disclaimer](Healthcare%20Dashboard%20-%20Title.png)
Important disclaimer noting that all data was generated using Python with pandas, numpy, and random libraries for demonstration purposes only. No real patient data or proprietary information was used.

### Data Sample Page
![Data Sample](Healthcare%20Dashboard%20-%20Data%20Sample.png)
The Data Sample page displays the structured dataset underlying the dashboard, including patient demographics, diagnostic information, and treatment metrics. The page includes interactive filters for Age Range, Gender, and Region, allowing healthcare providers to explore specific patient segments. Key fields include Pre-AHI and Post-AHI measurements which are critical for assessing treatment effectiveness.

### Overview Page
![Overview Dashboard](Healthcare%20Dashboard%20-%20Overview.png)
The overview dashboard displays key metrics including total patients, treatment distribution across different therapy types, and month-by-month trends of new patients by disorder type. This provides healthcare administrators with a high-level view of patient volume and treatment patterns.

### Treatment Effectiveness
![Treatment Effectiveness](Healthcare%20Dashboard%20-%20Treatment%20Effectiveness.png)
This page analyzes treatment success rates across different disorder types, with Sleep Apnea showing the highest success rate. The comparison of pre- and post-AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea Index) averages helps clinicians understand which treatments are most effective for different conditions.

### Operational Metrics & Geographical Analysis
![Operational Metrics](Healthcare%20Dashboard%20-%20Operational%20Metrics.png)
The operational metrics page features heat maps showing disorder prevalence by region and appointment cancellation patterns by day of week and region. The 78% appointment adherence rate is a key performance indicator for clinic operations.

## Technical Implementation
- Data preparation with Python
- Data structuring in Excel
- Advanced visualization using Microsoft Power BI
- DAX measures for calculated metrics

## DISCLAIMER
The information within this dataset is entirely fictional. No real patient data was used in the creation of this dashboard. This project is for demonstration purposes only.
