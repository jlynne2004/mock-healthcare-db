# Mock Healthcare Dashboard

A comprehensive Power BI dashboard for tracking key performance indicators related to healthcare diagnostics, created to demonstrate data visualization and healthcare analytics capabilities.

## Project Overview
This dashboard was created to explore how data visualization can support healthcare providers in tracking key metrics related to patient diagnostics and treatment outcomes. Using a fictional dataset, it simulates a clinicâ€™s ability to monitor trends, assess treatment effectiveness, and make data-informed decisions to improve care delivery.

## Repository Contents
- Python script for data processing and preparation
- Excel dataset with mock shealthcare metrics
- Power BI dashboard file with interactive visualizations

### Title and Data Disclaimer
![Disclaimer](Healthcare%20Dashboard%20-%20Title.png)
Important disclaimer noting that all data was generated using Python with pandas, numpy, and random libraries for demonstration purposes only. No real patient data or proprietary information was used.

### Data Sample Page
![Data Sample](Healthcare%20Dashboard%20-%20Data%20Sample.png)
The Data Sample page displays the structured dataset underlying the dashboard, including patient demographics, diagnostic information, and treatment metrics. The page includes interactive filters for Age Range, Gender, and Region, allowing healthcare providers to explore specific patient segments. Key fields include pre- and post-treatment measurements which are critical for assessing treatment effectiveness.

### Overview Page
![Overview Dashboard](Healthcare%20Dashboard%20-%20Overview.png)
The overview dashboard displays key metrics including total patients, treatment distribution across different therapy types, and month-by-month trends of new patients by disorder type. This provides healthcare administrators with a high-level view of patient volume and treatment patterns.

### Treatment Effectiveness
![Treatment Effectiveness](Healthcare%20Dashboard%20-%20Treatment%20Effectiveness.png)
This page analyzes treatment success rates across different disorder types. The comparison of pre- and post-treatment averages helps clinicians understand which interventions are most effective for different conditions.

### Operational Metrics & Geographical Analysis
![Operational Metrics](Healthcare%20Dashboard%20-%20Operational%20Metrics.png)
The operational metrics page features heat maps showing disorder prevalence by region and appointment cancellation patterns by day of week and region. The 78% appointment adherence rate is a key performance indicator for clinic operations.

## Technical Implementation
- Data preparation with Python
- Data structuring in Excel
- Advanced visualization using Microsoft Power BI
- DAX measures for calculated metrics

## DISCLAIMER
The information within this dataset is entirely fictional. No real patient data was used in the creation of this dashboard. This project is for demonstration purposes only.
